These are examples of typical Watcher Alerts, by design the automation component will fill in the variables. For example, you can choose to use BRO/HBSS/ACAS logs or allow the algorithm to chose for you. In addition, you design will allow you the user to pass in the parameter such as aggregation variable, email send to list(s), type of nested aggregation can also be passed in as reference for instance.
TODO: Automation can be perform on any part of the Watch. Further discussion may ultimately be required; however, for the most part its plug-and-play with a pass of the variables such as time intervals, username, and even aggregation criteria.
